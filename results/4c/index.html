<blockquote>Woman presentation and facts | THE EVOLUTION OF THE, In the dark ages of the early 1990s internet users sought to make their stamp on internet history by forging a new type of voyeurism and narcissism. In 1994 the blog was born, and since then, human interaction has never been the same. I WANT TO BELIEVE, ONLINE DIARY The modern blogger evolved from early online diaries and threads in the. Forum members would often keep a running online account of their day - to - day activities, THE ORIGINATOR In January 1994, Justin Hall, a student at Swarthmore University created the first blog, Justin&#39;s Links From the Underground A new era of self - initiated documentation began, WEB + LOG Jorn Barger is the apparent originator of the term &#39; inspired from the term &#39; logging the web He was later accused of being a homeless vagrant. The beard may have something to do with that, PETER MERHOLZ In an act of sheer laziness that will shape the course of human events for centuries to come, Peter Merholz shortens weblog to blog, in order for it to fit in the side bar of his online diary, EMO BLOGGER, ANGRY BLOGGER, Early forms of blogs fell into several categories. A prehistoric ancestor to the present day hipster, emo - bloggers found comfort and solace in online diaries such as LiveJournal There they could emote for hours on end about the tortures of being a middle - class teenager, Bloggers, such as the Misanthropic Bitch came onto the scene, armed with their web software, salty language, and an all - consuming anger about, well everything, OBSESSIVE BLOGGER, OCD, TRAVEL BLOGGER, POLITICAL BLOGGER, This subspecialty &#39; of bloggers included those who were passionately interested in a singular area or topic, and sought to find other bloggers who carried similar affections. From Angry Bloggers evolved a species of political bloggers. Political bloggers quickly gained power and respect through their critical eye and savvy ability to research E.g. &#39; Trent Lott Scandal &#39;, began the evolution of specialty, or theme blogs, such as those on blogspot, ACTIVIST BLOGGER, FOOD BLOGGER, GREEN, TECH BLOGGER, APPLE FAN BOY BLOGGER, Most noted for their ability to post photos of secret apple technology. A more recent evolution has been the hipster, GAMING BLOGGER, MEME BLOGGER, D.I.Y BLOGGER, FAIL, ART &amp; DESIGN BLOGGER, FASHION BLOGGER, A radioactive mutation caused some groups of tech bloggers to become meme bloggers. They are known to repost images and internet colloquialisms, Ala Martha Stewart, CELEBRITY GOSSIP BLOGGER, Also includes Street fashion, runway fashion and trash fashion, A hybrid of hipster and meme bloggers, gossip bloggers emerged as trash - talking money - makers. From these types of blogs came the creation of new forms. DO, PHOTOBLOG, VLOG, LINKLOG, SPAM BOT BLOGGER, COMPANY BLOGGER, NEXT GENERATION The next generation of bloggers is believed to be the micro - blogging bloggers. These, mostly seen on Twitter, have taken what oggers would say in 12,000 words and condensed it down to 140 characters of emotion. Don&#39;t be fooled by the cuddly exterior, these robots are armed and dangerous. Their sole purpose is to repost links and keywords, Based on the proven success of blogging as an industry and platform, companies are increasingly entering the space to promote their products, services and leaders. While many tend to promote extremely pro messages, there are a number of modern company blogs which are also the source of original and useful content. Flowtown, Sources : Economist</blockquote>
